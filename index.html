        <p class="text-margins"><b>Augusta Ada King-Noel, Countess of Lovelace, also called Ada Lovelace, is considered by many to be the world's first computer programmer. She was an English mathematician and writer who worked on a very early mechanical computer invented by Charles Babbage. The first algorithm intended to be calculated by a computing machine is found in her notes about the engine. Ada is considered an early pioneer in computing and the programming language Ada was named after her. This language was created for the United States Department of Defense and its reference manual was approved in 1980. Today, she serves as a historical role model for women and girls pursuing careers in technology.</b>

        <ul id="timeline">
          <li><b>1815:</b> Ada is born as Augusta Ada Byron on December 10 in London, England to the poet George Lord Byron and Anne Isabella Milbanke, Lady Wentworth.</li>
          <li><b>1815:</b> Her father separates from her mother a month after Ada's birth, and then moves away from England four months later. Ada's mother is bitter towards him and encourages Ada's interest in mathematics and logic as a way to prevent her from
            becoming "insane" like her father.</li>
          <li><b>1833:</b> Ada first meets Charles Babbage through her private tutor, Mary Somerville.</li>
          <li><b>1835:</b> Ada marries William Lord King. Three years later, he becomes the Earl of Lovelace, making her Countess of Lovelace.</li>
          <li><b>1842-1843:</b> Ada translates an article written in French by Italian engineer Luigi Menabrea on Babbage's Analytical Engine. With this, she writes a supplementary set of notes, entitled <em>Notes.</em> In these notes are found an algorithm designed
            to be carried out by the Engine, which many consider to be the first computer program.</li>
          <li><b>1832:</b> Ada Lovelace dies at age 36 from uterine cancer on November 27. At her request, she is buried next to her father in Hucknall, Nottinghmashire at the Church of St. Mary Magdalene.</li>
